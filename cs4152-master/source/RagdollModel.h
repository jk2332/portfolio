//  RagdollModel.h
//  Weather Defender
//
//  This module provides the infamous Walker White ragdoll from 3152.  This time it
//  is fully assembled for you.
//
//  WARNING: There are a lot of shortcuts in this design that will do not adapt
//  well to data driven design.  This demo has a lot of simplifications to make
//  it a bit easier to see how everything fits together.  However, the model
//  classes and how they are initialized will need to be changed if you add
//  dynamic level loading.
//
//  Pay close attention to how this class designed. This class uses our standard
//  shared-pointer architecture which is common to the entire engine.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
