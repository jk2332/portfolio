 * in addition, you should remember to call begin() at the start of the
 * method.

 * You do not need to worry about whether the node uses relative color.
 * This method is called by render() and these values are guaranteed to be
 * correct.  In addition, this method does not need to check for visibility,
 * as it is guaranteed to only be called when the node is visible.

 * @param matrix    The global transformation matrix.
 * @param tint      The tint to blend with the Node color.
