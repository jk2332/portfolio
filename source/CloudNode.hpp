    /**
     * This is a scene graph node representing a solid 2D polygon textured by a sprite.
     *
     * The polygon is specified in image coordinates. Image coordinates are different
     * from texture coordinates. Their origin is at the bottom-left corner of the file,
     * and each pixel is one unit. This makes specifying a polygon more natural for
     * irregular shapes.
     *
     * This means that a polygon with vertices (0,0), (width,0), (width,height),
     * and (0,height) would be identical to a sprite node. However, a polygon with
     * vertices (0,0), (2*width,0), (2*width,2*height), and (0,2*height) would tile
     * the sprite (given the wrap settings) twice both horizontally and vertically.
     *
     * The content size of this node is defined by the size (but not the offset)
     * of the bounding box.  The anchor point is relative to this content size.
     * The default anchor point in TexturedNode is (0.5, 0.5).  This means that a
     * uniform translation of the polygon (in contrast to the node itself) will not
     * move the shape on the the screen.  Instead, it will just change the part of
     * the texture it uses.
     *
     * For example, suppose the texture has given width and height.  We have one
     * polygon with vertices (0,0), (width/2,0), (width/2,height/2), and (0,height/2).
     * We have another polygon with vertices (width/2,height/2), (width,height/2),
     * (width,height), and (width/2,height).  Both polygons would create a rectangle
     * of size (width/2,height/2). centered at the node position.  However, the
     * first would use the bottom left part of the texture, while the second would
     * use the top right.
