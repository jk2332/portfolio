# High Concept Statement

One stormy night, a bolt of lightning strikes the top of an evil research corporation where you, the janitor, are working on the top floor. As a power surge rips throughout the building, you must fight and maneuver through floors of released monsters and research experiments all the way down to the basement and make your escape.

# Features

Bash enemies with a mop to damage and subdue them.
Stun enemies with spray bottles to buy some time or focus on other enemies.
Suck in close projectiles or distant enemies with a vacuum to constrain them.
Hurl garbage lids to damage ranged enemies who keep their distance.

# Design Goals

**Combination of Action and Survival**

Janiterror encourages players to think quickly and tactically as they control a super janitor who must carefully survive through a gauntlet of monster-ridden floors. Players will feel like a clever strategist as they utilize unconventional weapons and snap decision-making to eliminate enemies and progress to the game’s exit. Additionally, the fragile nature of the janitor’s cleaning supplies forces players into making tough strategic choices while managing their limited resources, giving players a sense of danger yet satisfaction in their decisions.


**Comical Atmosphere**

The absurd premise and comical atmosphere of Janiterror is intended to appeal to a players looking for an engaging action game with a bit of silliness. Janiterror’s pixelated art style evokes a sense of arcade nostalgia intended for older players between the ages of 20-40, and the janitor’s joking quips and the game’s zany weapon combinations will help attract players with quirky senses of humor.

# Unique Selling Points

Comical and Unconventional Hero - Most action games involve players controlling stereotypical heroes with supernatural powers or extraordinary capabilities. Conversely, Janiterror puts players in control of an elderly janitor armed with only cleaning supplies to fight through waves of monsters. The creative and humorous premise of Janiterror gives the game a distinctive hook. In addition, whenever players complete a level, the janitor says a cleaning-related pun to the players such as “You just mopped the floor with those monsters!”, adding a sense of quirky, ridiculous humor to the game.

Unique Take on Survival - Janiterror uniquely blends action game elements like weapon loadouts with survival game elements like resource management. Due to the humorous and fragile nature of the janitor’s weapons, each of them break over time. This eventually forces players to reach optional mop cart stations scattered throughout the levels, which allow them to restock on weapons and health. This creates critical dilemma situations throughout the game where players must decide between the risk of extra monsters and obstacles, and the reward of the mop cart’s supplies.
Multiple Weapon Options - As opposed to other combat systems, players in Janiterror are allowed to dual wield various janitorial supplies, each weapon with its own advantages and disadvantages. Players can choose their weapon loadouts based on how they want to play, whether they prefer bashing monsters and facing enemies head on with the mop or keeping their distance and focusing on objectives with the spray bottles. Each of these weapons can be combined with various enemies and hazards, allowing for the creation of emergent behavior.


# Additional Details

One of the key components of Janiterror is that the janitor must overcome a variety of enemies that are based in an evil research corporation. Accordingly, we’ve chosen a cast of enemies to suit the game’s theme.

Mad Scientist - Mad Scientists are the most basic enemy that attack in melee range. Though not powerful individually, in groups they can pose more of a threat. In addition, in later levels, variants of the Mad Scientist can wear accessories such as gas masks, which prevent them from getting stunned by spray bottles but can be removed by the suction of the vacuum. These accessories encourage the use of different weapon loadouts and experimentation by players.

Slimes - Slimes have the same health as Mad Scientists; however, Slimes move more slowly and attack players via range by shooting slime balls. Though more dangerous if players are not aware of them, Slimes can be easily targeted by the garbage lid because of their slow nature, or nullified by the vacuum, which both sucks up the slime balls and brings the Slimes closer to players.

Lizardmen - The Lizardmen are faster but weaker units than the Mad Scientist, and they are often found in small packs. Their speed makes them hard to hit normally; however, ranged weapons like the spray bottles can help players incapacitate them, making them easy prey for damaging weapons like the mop or the garbage lid.

Robots - Robots are slow moving but more durable units than Mad Scientists. Robots cannot be moved by the suction of the vacuum, making them living barriers that might foil players’ plans. However, their circuitry makes them much more prone to liquid-based weapons such as the spray bottles.

# Conclusion

Janiterror is a game that builds upon those that have come before it to create something new. The game blends traditional action and resource management mechanics to create deep and strategic gameplay. Additionally, Janiterror’s unique premise, comical atmosphere, and quirky jokes all add a splash of zaniness to the game, while its pixelated art style evokes a sense of arcade nostalgia in a modern framework. With its challenging combat, layered gameplay, and entertaining premise, Janiterror is a game that’s sure to sweep you off your feet.
