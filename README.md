Weather Defender is a resource management game that challenges players to protect their farm’s harvest from harsh weather patterns and ravenous pests. With multiple crops to tend to at once, keeping the harvest safe throughout the day is a tall order. Thankfully, a band of little storm clouds is here to help! Players can guide the kindly clouds to satisfy the ever-changing needs of their crops and keep the hungry critters at bay.

The clouds can be moved, split apart, and combined to provide shade or sunlight to crops across the entire field. Clouds can also create weather, like rain, to water crops. Players must direct the clouds carefully, though: they only have a limited number of clouds at their disposal and creating weather like rain causes clouds to dissipate over time. What’s more, too much rain or sunlight could cause a crop to die! Thoughtful resource management is the only way to nurture a lush farmland.

Each level takes place over the course of a single day. All of the crops will start off as buds and will develop a need for sunlight, shade, or rain over time. If the player can continually satiate the crops’ needs, they will continually grow larger until they become fully-grown. There is no time to rest, though! Players must watch out for pests eager to feast on their hard-day’s work. With the help of a raincloud, players can scare off those varmints with a friendly jolt of lightning!

With risks associated with every choice players make, there are many things to consider when distributing clouds across the field. Players must remember that the size of a cloud determines how many crops it can affect at once. Is it better to spread out a bunch of small clouds or condense the clouds to deal with clusters of crops? How will things go if this cloud becomes a raincloud and disappears? Players are encouraged to come up with their own unique solutions to these questions in each level and optimize for maximum plant growth. 

Weather Defender is a iOS mobile game that is being created by seven Cornell University students. Weather Defender adds a new twist to the resource management genre by providing players with clouds as resources to manipulate. Dragging, slicing apart, and pinching together clouds is an interactive control scheme that is well-suited to the mobile interface. Actively rearranging the clouds like this gives players a more engaging experience than many other resource management games.
