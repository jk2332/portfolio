# User Interface Demo

This demo shows off the new user interface elements for 2018.  The game is split into
four different scenes: a button demo, a slider demo, a text box demo, and a layout
format demo.  All of these scenes are defined using our scene graph specification
language in assets.json, but we connect the listeners programmatically in the source code.

To switch between the screens use shift+left/right on the desktop.  On mobile you should
double tab on either the left or right of the screen.
